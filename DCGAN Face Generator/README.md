# Project Overview

In this project I have developed a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversial Network (DCGAN) which generates new human faces. 

The model consists of: 
- **A discriminator:** Convolution Neural Network which main purpose is to classify fake from real face images. It consists of 4 convolutional and 1 linear layers with batch normalization and leaky-relu as the activation function in most of the layers. 
- **A generator:** Deconvolutional Neural Network which main purpose is to generate new face from a random vector space `z`. It consists of a linear and 4 deconvolutional layers with batch normalization and relu and tanh activation functions. 

The generator will try to make the discriminator believe his images are real and the discriminator will try to differenciate accurately real from fake images. It will be this competition between both networks what will train the network and as the discriminator improves so it will the generator and viceversa. This is the outline of the whole network with the discriminator and generator: 

```

Discriminator(
  (conv1): Sequential(
    (0): Conv2d(3, 32, kernel_size=(4, 4), stride=(2, 2), padding=(1, 1), bias=False)
  )
  (conv2): Sequential(
    (0): Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=(4, 4), stride=(2, 2), padding=(1, 1), bias=False)
    (1): BatchNorm2d(64, eps=1e-05, momentum=0.1, affine=True, track_running_stats=True)
  )
  (conv3): Sequential(
    (0): Conv2d(64, 128, kernel_size=(4, 4), stride=(2, 2), padding=(1, 1), bias=False)
    (1): BatchNorm2d(128, eps=1e-05, momentum=0.1, affine=True, track_running_stats=True)
  )
  (conv4): Sequential(
    (0): Conv2d(128, 256, kernel_size=(4, 4), stride=(2, 2), padding=(1, 1), bias=False)
    (1): BatchNorm2d(256, eps=1e-05, momentum=0.1, affine=True, track_running_stats=True)
  )
  (fc): Linear(in_features=1024, out_features=1, bias=True)
)

Generator(
  (fc): Linear(in_features=100, out_features=1024, bias=True)
  (deconv1): Sequential(
    (0): ConvTranspose2d(256, 128, kernel_size=(4, 4), stride=(2, 2), padding=(1, 1), bias=False)
    (1): BatchNorm2d(128, eps=1e-05, momentum=0.1, affine=True, track_running_stats=True)
  )
  (deconv2): Sequential(
    (0): ConvTranspose2d(128, 64, kernel_size=(4, 4), stride=(2, 2), padding=(1, 1), bias=False)
    (1): BatchNorm2d(64, eps=1e-05, momentum=0.1, affine=True, track_running_stats=True)
  )
  (deconv3): Sequential(
    (0): ConvTranspose2d(64, 32, kernel_size=(4, 4), stride=(2, 2), padding=(1, 1), bias=False)
    (1): BatchNorm2d(32, eps=1e-05, momentum=0.1, affine=True, track_running_stats=True)
  )
  (deconv4): Sequential(
    (0): ConvTranspose2d(32, 3, kernel_size=(4, 4), stride=(2, 2), padding=(1, 1), bias=False)
  )
)
```

The loss function used was the Binary Cross Entropy loss and the optimizers were Adam for both networks. For more information regarding the model architecture and the decission making taken to build this model [check the notebook with the DCGAN](https://github.com/Randulfe/Deep-Learning-Udacity-Nanodegree-Projects/blob/master/DCGAN%20Face%20Generator/dlnd_face_generation.ipynb).

## Outcome

After 30 epochs of traning with a batch size of 32, this is the plot of the discriminator vs generator errors over the training epochs:

And this were some of the faces generated by my network (32x32 pixels):

### Instructions

The important parts of this project are in the `dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb` file. However, if you wish to follow this project and run it locally, you can follow [these instructions](https://github.com/Randulfe/Deep-Learning-Udacity-Nanodegree-Projects/tree/master/Bike%20Sharing%20Patterns%20Neural%20Network%20for%20Nanodegree#instructions) but changing the command of Step 1 to `https://github.com/Randulfe/Deep-Learning-Udacity-Nanodegree-Projects/new/master/RNN%20TV%20Script%20Generator`.
